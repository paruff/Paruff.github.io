Intermittent fasting is as we are doing it is simply extending your daily fast , that is what breakfast does, from 12 hours to 18-20. So last month we did an 18/6 intermittent fast, this month we will be doing a 4/20 fast and next month the plan is to eat one meal a day, so almost a 23 our fast or in the pattern from above 1/23.

We are complementing this with some delicious plant based food from Dr. Fuhrman's recipes. He recently added a meal plan to his members area to support intermittent fasting. We find the food takes time to prepare and is a lot! So we are working on how to right size the meals.
